        <p><h3 style="font-size:15px;">I am adopted</h3></p>
        <p style="font-size:13px;">I was adopted officially back in 2010 a few weeks before my fifth birthday. I was put into 
            the foster system when I was two but was still in contact with my biological family up untill I was four. I have
            one biological sister and five other siblings that I gained from being adopted. I love being adopted. It has 
            given me lots of opportunities and helped me in the long run. I get to have two families now and the support I 
            recieve is unmatched. 
        </p>
        <p><h3 stlye="padding-top:2%; font-size:15px;">Niches</h3></p>
        <p style="font-size:13px;">I've got a lot of little niches that I've picked up over the years. Such things include
        crocheting, archery, piano, writing, sewing, paint, draw, and others that I cannot think of off the top of my head.
        The point is I can do a lot of things and could be called a jack of all trades kind of gal. </p>
        <p><h3 style="padding-top: 1%; font-size: 15px;">Surrounded by the military</h3></p>
        <p style="font-size:13px;"> I am completely surrounded by military life. I was born with family memebers being in 
            the military and when I was adopted my father was in the army. He was in for 28 years. Then I almost joined the
            navy before I recieved a full scholarship to the University of North Alabama (UNA). But then my boyfriend joined
            the marines so I may never escape the military lifestye for good. </p>
         <hr style="background: black; height:2px;">
        <p><h2 style="padding: 2%;">Hobbies</h2></p>
         <p><h3 style="font-size:15px;">Sewing</h3></p>
            <p style="font-size:13px;">I've been sewing since I was 11 years old and I like to think I'm quite good at it. 
            I've made things ranging from bedding, to prom dresses, to sock monkeys. I'm still learning but I'm well equiped
            in my skill and if I needed to I could sew or tailor clothes for a job.
            </p>
        <p><h3 stlye="padding-top:2%; font-size:15px;">Reading</h3></p>
            <p style="font-size:13px;">I read. A lot. I used to read around 30/hrs a week. Now I try to focus more on school
            but when I find a book I like, I can finish it in a couple days even if the book verges on 1,000 pages. My favorite
            series is called <a style= "font-size:13px; color:rgb(51, 51, 51)"href="https://sarahjmaas.com/books/throne-of-glass-series/throne-of-glass/">
            Throne of Glass</a></p>
        <p><h3 style="font-size: 15px;">Writing</h3></p>
            <p style="font-size:13px;">I love to write. I always have and I hope I always will. Currently most of my writing 
            done in the form of letters to my best friend in the marines but I usually try to journal or write small stories.
            When I was younger I would fill the backs of old notebooks that weren't completely filled from school with story ideas.
            I don't think I'll ever publish anything though. Writing is definitely just a hobby.
        </p>

        <p><h2 style="padding: 3%;">Envolvments</h2></p>
        <p><h3 style="font-size:15px;">Geography club</h3></p>
           <p style="font-size:13px;"> So I'm apart of UNA's Geography club. So far I've enjoyed it. We went Kiyaking, and I've
        joined the intramural volleyball team. We aren't too good at it but with some practice we can be. I'm looking 
        forward to what the future holds for this club.</p>
       <p><h3 stlye="padding-top:2%; font-size:15px;">Tutor</h3></p>
           <p style="font-size:13px;">I am a wiz when it comes to math. I've excelled at it since elementary school and I've
        been tutoring for the past three years. I specialize in math tutoring but occasionally will help in other subjects.
        For example, I peer edit lots of english papers and will help students study for science when need be.</Form></p>
       <p><h3 style="font-size: 15px;">Work</h3></p>
           <p style="font-size:13px;">I've only been working for the past two years. Mainly in customer service jobs.
        I worked fast food for a year and a half and worked retail for a year and I've been serving for 10 months. Now I 
        bet you looked at the times and said "The math isn't mathing" and that would be because for most of the past two
        years I worked two jobs at once. Just helped me get the hours I needed.</p>
        <hr style="background: black; height:5px;">
        <p><i>All-in-all I've got a lot to look forward to in the future. I've got many open paths infront of me and 
            I'm just going to watch where life takes me. I appreciate you reading until the end and hope to see you next time.
