        <hr style="background: black; height:2px;">
            <p style= "font-size:14px; text-align:center;"> I am a freshman at The University of North Alabama, studying computer science.</p>
        <p style= "font-size:13px; padding-top:2%;text-align:center;">So let's get started</p>

        <p><h2 style="padding-top: 5%;">Fun Facts</h2></p>
        <p><h3 style="font-size:15px;">I am adopted</h3></p>
        <p style="font-size:13px;">I was adopted officially back in 2010 a few weeks before my fifth birthday. I was put into 
            the foster system when I was two but was still in contact with my biological family up untill I was four. I have
            one biological sister and five other siblings that I gained from being adopted. I love being adopted. It has 
            given me lots of opportunities and helped me in the long run. I get to have two families now and the support I 
            recieve is unmatched. 
        </p>
        <p><h3 stlye="padding-top:2%; font-size:15px;">Niches</h3></p>
        <p style="font-size:13px;">I've got a lot of little niches that I've picked up over the years. Such things include
        crocheting, archery, piano, writing, sewing, paint, draw, and others that I cannot think of off the top of my head.
        The point is I can do a lot of things and could be called a jack of all trades kind of gal. </p>
        <p><h3 style="padding-top: 1%; font-size: 15px;">Surrounded by the military</h3></p>
        <p style="font-size:13px;"> I am completely surrounded by military life. I was born with family memebers being in 
            the military and when I was adopted my father was in the army. He was in for 28 years. Then I almost joined the
            navy before I recieved a full scholarship to the University of North Alabama (UNA). But then my boyfriend joined
            the marines so I may never escape the military lifestye for good. </p>
        <p><h2 style="padding-top: 5%;">Hobbies</h2></p>
         <p><h3 style="font-size:15px;">Sewing</h3></p>
            <p style="font-size:13px;">I've been sewing since I was 11 years old and I like to think I'm quite good at it. 
            </p>
        <p><h3 stlye="padding-top:2%; font-size:15px;">Reading</h3></p>
            <p style="font-size:13px;">I read. A lot. I used to read around 30/hrs a week. Now I try to focus more on school
            but when I find a book I like, I can finish it in a couple days even if the book verges on 1,000 pages.</p>
        <p><h3 style="font-size: 15px;">Writing</h3></p>
            <p style="font-size:13px;">I love to write. I always have and I hope I always will. Currently most of my writing 
            done in the form of letters to my best friend in the marines but I usually try to journal or write small stories.
